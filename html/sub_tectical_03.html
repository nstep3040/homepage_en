                The DIGITAL SEXTANT is the first electronic sextant in the world and gives users quick and rapid
                identification of location plus reliable back-up in case of GPS malfunction or failure.
                A sextant is an essential instrument on any ship or vessel, designed to measure the altitude
                angle between the horizon and celestial body (such as the sun, moon or a star), and is used to
                determine the ship’s latitude and longitude position, especially in the event of the failure of
                the ship’s GPS navigation system.
